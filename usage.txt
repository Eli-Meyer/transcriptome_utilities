-------------------------
CompareContamSeq.pl
-------------------------

Identifies the most likely origin of each sequence in a transcriptome assembly
by comparison with a protein DB from a single close relative, and one or more 
databases of likely contaminants. e.g. for corals, A. digitifera would be a
good target and Symbiodinium would be a likely contaminant.
Each sequence is assigned to the source which it matches best.

Usage: CompareContamSeq.pl queries score target_db contam_db1 ... contam_dbN
	queries:	FASTA-formatted file of DNA sequences (e.g. transcripts)
	score:		bit-score threshold (matches this high or higher count as a match)
	target_db:	BLAST-formatted protein database of a closely related species
	contam_db1:	first BLAST-formatted protein database of an expected contaminant
	contam_dbN:	last BLAST-formatted protein database of an expected contaminant

-------------------------
GeneMiner.pl
-------------------------

Finds candidate matches for a gene of interest in an annotated transcriptome assembly.
This script assumes the transcriptome was annotated using GenesFromLocalDB.pl.
Usage: GeneMiner.pl list db transcriptome label
Where:	list:		a list of one or more accession numbers for your gene of interest.
			(Note that these must match sequences in your BLAST db)
	db:		a protein FASTA file, previously used to annotate the transcriptome (e.g. uniprot.fasta)
	transcriptome:	the FASTA formatted, annotated transcriptome assembly.
	label:		a short code describing the transcriptome or gene (useful when concatenating 
			outputs from multiple searches)

-------------------------
GenesFromLocalDB.pl
-------------------------

Assigns gene names to a set of DNA sequences based on sequence similarity
with other genes of known function.  This script relies on both a local
sequence database (formatted for blast) (UniProt is recommended) and a local
definitions file in which each sequence ID is associated with a gene name.
e.g. "Accession1	Gene name or description", produced using GetGeneNames.sh
Output:	 a table of best matches and a fasta file of annotated sequences.
Usage:	 GenesFromLocalDB.pl -i=seqs -b=exclude -n/p=db -a=defs
Arguments:
	 -i=seqs	 fasta file of sequences to be annotated
	 -t=threads	 number of threads to use in blast search
	 -b=exclude	 a text file of 'bad words' to be excluded (e.g. 'uncharacterized')
	 -p/n=db1	 The sequence database to search. p=protein, n=nucleotide
	 -a=defs	 Tab delimited file of gene names associated with that db (ID, Name).
	 -e=evalue	 critical e-value for blast search.
	 -o=outopt:	"yes" = initially write blast report to /data/custom_directory, then copy to
			 working directory and remove /data/custom_directory. (choose this at CGRB)
			"no"= write to working directory (choose this option on most systems)


-------------------------
GetRepTranscripts.pl
-------------------------

Selects the longest representative for each component or
subcomponent in a Trinity transcriptome assembly.
Usage: GetRepTranscripts.pl assembly.fasta option output.tab output.fasta
Where:
	assembly.fasta:	the input file, assembled by Trinity
	option:		c for component, or s for subcomponent
	output.tab:	a name for the output summary file
	output.fasta:	a name for the output file of representative transcripts

-------------------------
GOAnnotTable.pl
-------------------------

Converts the ontology file from Gene Ontology website (http://www.geneontology.org/ontology/gene_ontology.obo)
into a tab-delimited annotations file suitable for use with GOFromGeneAnnotation.pl
Usage: GOAnnotTable.pl input > output

-------------------------
GOFromGeneAnnotation.pl
-------------------------

Assigns GO terms to a set of sequences already annotated with gene names based on UniProt.
Output:	 a fasta file of annotated sequences.
Usage:	 GOFromGeneAnnotation.pl input annotations output
Arguments:
	 input		fasta file of sequences to be annotated
	 annotations	file of Uniprot GO associations, produced using GOAnnotTable.pl
	 output		a name for the output file

-------------------------
RecipBestMatch_UniProt.pl
-------------------------

Identifies candidates for reciprocal best matches to a list of genes from UniProt
in a set of transcript sequences. Please note -- it is up to the user to examine these
candidate matches and decide whether they really count as the same gene or not.
Usage: RecipBestMatch_UniProt.pl list db gene_names badwords transcripts bitscore
Where:	list:		a list of UniProt accession numbers for the genes of interest.
	db:		complete path to the local BLAST-formatted UniProt database.
	gene_names:	tab delimited file associating each accession in the DB with a gene name
			(the output from GetGeneNames.sh)
	badwords:	a list of words to exclude; annotations matching these strings considered uninformative and skipped.
	bitscore:	critical (minimum) bit-score required to count as a valid match.

-------------------------
RemoveContamSeq.pl
-------------------------

Searches DNA sequences against a series of contaminant sets (rRNA, Mt, etc), and
removes sequences matching one or more contaminants as they are identified.
Please note that these searches are conducted in series. If a sequence is eliminated
because it matched a record in the first contaminant file, that sequence is not searched
against subsequent contaminant files.
Output:	 table showing the reason for removing discarded reads, and fasta file of reads that passed
Usage:	 script type= score= reads= contam= table= passed=
Arguments:
	 type= 		 type of blast (type=tblastx or blastn) 
	 score= 	 critcal bit-score threshold 
	 reads= 	 reads to search for contaminants, fasta file 
	 contam= 	 contaminant sequences, entered as contam=label,file 
				 where label is a name for that set of sequences (e.g., rRNA)
				 and file is the path to those sequences (e.g., /path/rrna.fasta)
			 you must enter contam=label,file once for each set of contaminants to search 
	 table= 	 name for the summary output table 
	 passed= 	 name for the passed sequences fasta output 

-------------------------
TaxaOriginByBlast.pl
-------------------------

Determines the most likely source for each sequence in a transcriptome assembly
based on the taxonomic ID of each sequence's best match in a DB containing
sequences from diverse taxa (NCBI's nr)
Usage: TaxaOriginByBlast.pl query db db_dir threshold level blastopt
	query:		fasta file of cDNA sequences
	db:		path to local nr database, preformatted with taxonomic information
	db_dir:		path to the directory containing db and taxonomy files from NCBI:
			(nodes.dmp, names.dmp, taxadb.bti, taxadb.btd in db_dir,
			id2names, names2id, nodes, parents in db_dir/bin)
	threshold:	bit-score threshold for blast matches
	level:		taxonomic level (kingdom, phylum, class, etc.), as defined in NCBI taxonomy
	blastopt:	Run BLAST? first time, enter TRUE. If re-running, enter FALSE
	outopt:		"yes" = initially write blast report to /data/custom_directory, then copy to
			 working directory and remove /data/custom_directory. (choose this at CGRB)
			"no"= write to working directory (choose this option on most systems)

-------------------------
GetGeneNames.sh
-------------------------

Prepares a tab delimited text file of gene names from the UniProt fasta file
Usage: script_name input
	input:	FASTA file containing all UniProt records (Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL)
