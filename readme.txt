This repository contains a series of scripts we find useful for annotating and otherwise
analyzing de novo transcriptome assemblues.
You'll also need the "sequence utilities" repositories, and several 
other software packages or modules installed and in your path:
BioPerl			http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Main_Page
NCBI BLAST

The usage information for each script (usage.txt) can be reproduced by running each script without arguments.

Any questions or bugs? Please contact Eli Meyer: eli.meyer@science.oregonstate.edu.
